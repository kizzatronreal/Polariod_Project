                    <p>The Sun 640 and Sun 660 were later models in the series with some upgraded features, but they all used the same film and had that classic instant camera magic.</p>

                    <p>
                        This is what the ads looked like. Very 80s, very bold. Built-in flash, instant 
                        square prints, and that distinctive Polaroid look. Marketing was all about the 
                        experience "see it now" was basically their whole pitch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These cameras weren't cheap at the time either. But people paid for them because 
                        there was literally nothing else like it. Want to see your photo right away? 
                        Polaroid was your only option.
