            <h2>Common Problems (And How to Fix Them)</h2>
            
            <h3>Camera's Dead - Won't Turn On</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The battery is IN the film pack, not the camera itself. Pop in a fresh pack of film</li>
                <li>Make sure the film pack clicked in all the way and that dark slide thing ejected</li>
                <li>If you've got an old film pack sitting around, it might be dead. Try a new one</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>My Photos Look Terrible (Too Dark/Light)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Try the lighten/darken slider </li>
                <li>Don't shoot super close or way far away. Sweet spot is about 4-10 feet</li>
                <li>Those little sensors on the front get dirty. Wipe 'em gently with a soft cloth</li>
                <li>Bright midday sun or super dark rooms are tough for this camera. It does better in normal indoor/outdoor lighting</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Photo Won't Come Out</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Check your film counter - you might be out of shots</li>
                <li>Take the film pack out and put it back in. Sometimes it just needs reseating</li>
                <li>Make sure the film door's totally closed</li>
                <li>If it's really stuck, DON'T force it. Seriously, call us instead</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Everything's Blurry</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hold still when you press the button! Camera shake is real</li>
                <li>Stay at least 4 feet away from whatever you're shooting</li>
                <li>Clean the lens with something soft (your shirt works in a pinch but microfiber is better)</li>
                <li>Make sure your subject is actually in the middle of the viewfinder</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Film Care Tips</h2>
            <p>
                Film is kinda picky, so here's what you need to know:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Store it somewhere cool and dry</li>
                <li>Keep it away from direct sunlight</li>
                <li>Use it before the expiration date </li>
                <li>If you keep film in the fridge (some people do), let it warm up to room temp before loading</li>
                <li>After you take a shot, shield it from bright light for about 5-10 minutes while it develops. Stick it in your pocket or under something</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Warranty Information</h2>
            <p>
                The Sun 600 came with a <strong>one-year warranty</strong> that covered manufacturing 
                defects. It didn't cover:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You dropped it (accidents happen, but we can't warranty that)</li>
                <li>Regular wear and tear</li>
                <li>Film issues - that's separate</li>
                <li>Scratches and cosmetic stuff that doesn't affect how it works</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you think you've got a warranty issue, call support with your receipt and tell them 
                what's wrong. They'll sort you out.
            </p>

            <h2>Manual Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lost your manual?</strong> Call customer support, they can send you a new one</li>
                <li><strong>Need repairs?</strong> Ask about authorized service centers in your area</li>
                <li><strong>Looking for film?</strong> Most camera shops carry it, or at least they should</li>

            <h2>Pro Tips for Better Photos</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep the sun behind YOU, not behind what you're photographing</li>
                <li>Use the flash indoors or when it's getting dark that's what it's there for</li>
                <li>Don't move until the photo comes out</li>
                <li>Protect developing photos from bright light immediately. Pocket, under a book, whatever works</li>
                <li>Store your finished photos in an album. They'll last way longer</li>
                <li>Give your camera a wipe down every now and then. It'll thank you</li>
            </ul>
