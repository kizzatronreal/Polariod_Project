                <p>Making instant photography a thing since 1937</p>

            <h2>How It All Started</h2>
            <p>
                Edwin H. Land and George W. Wheelwright III founded Polaroid back in <strong>1937</strong> 
                in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Originally they were working on polarizing filters (hence 
                the name), but Land had this wild idea about instant photography. His daughter asked 
                why she couldn't see a photo right away, and that got him thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first instant camera dropped in 1948, and people went nuts for it. By the 1980s, 
                when the 600 Series came out, Polaroid was HUGE. Like, household name status. Everyone 
                knew what a Polaroid was it became synonymous with instant photos.

            <h2>What We Were About</h2>
            <p>
                The whole point of Polaroid was simple: why should you wait days or weeks to see your 
                photos? We wanted to make photography instant and accessible. No complicated equipment, 
                no darkroom skills needed. Just point, shoot, and watch your photo develop. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We believed memories should be tangible. Something you could hold, pass around, stick 
                on the fridge. Digital wasn't even a concept yet we were the instant gratification 
                before instant gratification was everywhere.

            <h2>Tech Information</h2>
            <p>
                Polaroid wasn't just slapping cameras together. We actually invented some pretty 
                groundbreaking technology:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Instant film development</strong> - The chemistry to make photos develop without a darkroom was genuinely revolutionary</li>
                <li><strong>Integral film</strong> - Everything needed was built into one film pack. Battery, chemicals, the works</li>
                <li><strong>SX-70 technology</strong> - That folding SLR camera was legitimately ahead of its time</li>
                <li><strong>600 Series film</strong> - Higher ISO meant better shots in crummy lighting</li>
                <li><strong>Light Management System</strong> - Helped the camera figure out exposure automatically</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Quality Control (Or: Why Most Still Work)</h2>
            <p>
                These cameras were built pretty solid. Sure, they were plastic and had some quirks, 
                but Polaroid actually tested them quite a bit. The company backed them with real 
                warranties and had decent customer service for the era.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fact that you can still find working Sun 600s today says something. They weren't 
                meant to be disposable they were meant to last. Some are still clicking away 40+ 
                years later, which is honestly kind of amazing when you think about it.
