            <h2>Company History</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in <strong>1937</strong> by Edwin H. Land and George W. Wheelwright III, 
                Polaroid Corporation revolutionized photography with the invention of instant film. 
                The company's headquarters was located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where it became 
                one of the most innovative technology companies of the 20th century.
            </p>
            <p>
                The introduction of the first instant camera in 1948 marked the beginning of a new 
                era in photography. By the 1980s, Polaroid had become a household name, with the 
                600 Series cameras representing the pinnacle of instant photography technology.

                your hand, creating tangible keepsakes that last a lifetime.
